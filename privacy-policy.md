# Visiora AI - Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: May 07, 2025_

Welcome to Visiora AI ("we," "us," "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the App.

## 1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:

### a. **Personal Data for Functionality:**

- **Device Identifier (Device UUID):** We automatically assign a unique Device UUID to your installation of the App. This UUID is used to manage your access, track your usage limits, associate your subscriptions, and for analytics purposes. It is stored locally on your device via Keychain and sent to our backend servers.
- **Push Notification Token:** If you grant permission, we collect your push notification token to send you updates about your image generations, promotions, and other relevant App information. This token is stored locally and on our backend servers.
- **Device Information:** We may collect basic device information such as device model, iOS version, and language settings to optimize app performance and troubleshoot issues.

### b. **User-Provided Content for AI Generation:**

- **Images and Drawings:** When you use features like "Image-to-Image," "Draw-to-Image," "Portrait," "Feature You," or "Toy Maker," you provide us with images or drawings. These are uploaded to our servers in Base64 encoded format.
- **Text Prompts:** When you use features like "Text-to-Image" or "Caricature," or provide style prompts or data for "Toy Maker," you provide us with text. This text is sent to our servers.
- **This content is sent to OpenAI (our third-party AI service provider) to generate the AI images.**
- **We do not use your uploaded images or text prompts for any purpose other than generating the requested AI image.**

### c. **Usage Data & Analytics:**

- **Feature Usage:** We track which features of the App you use (e.g., "text_to_image," "portrait"), the timestamp of use, and associate this with your Device UUID. This data is sent to our backend for internal analytics to improve the App.
- **Device Status Information:** Our backend maintains information about your Device UUID, including your premium status, free trial usage, remaining generations, subscription type, trial end date, and generation history (job status, feature type used).
- **Performance Metrics:** We collect anonymous data about app performance, such as generation times, error rates, and app crashes to improve service reliability.

### d. **Purchase Information (via RevenueCat):**

When you make a purchase (e.g., subscribe to a premium plan), our third-party payment processor, RevenueCat, handles the transaction. We receive confirmation of your purchase status (e.g., premium active, subscription type, trial end date) from RevenueCat, which is associated with your Device UUID on our backend. We do not directly collect or store your payment card details.

### e. **Locally Stored Data (on your device):**

- **Generated Images & History:** The App allows you to save generated images and maintains a local history of your generations (metadata and image file names) within the App's private storage on your device.
- **Cached Data:** We may cache certain data locally, such as your device status, to improve App performance.
- **Onboarding Status:** We store whether you have completed the onboarding process in UserDefaults.
- **App Settings:** We store your app preferences and settings locally on your device.

## 2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the App to:

- Provide and manage the AI image generation services.
- Manage your account status (free, trial, premium) and enforce usage limits.
- Process your subscriptions and restore purchases via RevenueCat.
- Send you push notifications related to your image generations, App updates, promotions, and reminders, if you have opted-in.
- Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the App and develop new features.
- Maintain a history of your generation jobs on our backend for status tracking and to calculate usage limits.
- Ensure the security and integrity of our App and backend systems.
- Respond to customer service requests and provide technical support.
- Debug and improve the App functionality and user experience.
- Comply with legal obligations.

## 3. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:

### a. **Third-Party Service Providers:**

- **Analytics Providers:** We may use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends. These tools collect information sent by your device, including the features you use and time spent on the App, to help us improve the App and user experience.

### b. **By Law or to Protect Rights:**

If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.
