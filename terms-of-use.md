Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you do not have permission to access the Service.

## 1. SERVICE DESCRIPTION

Visiora AI is a mobile application that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate and modify images based on user-provided inputs, such as existing images, drawings, or text prompts ("User Content"). Our services include image-to-image transformation, drawing-to-image conversion, portrait generation, caricature creation, and other AI-powered image generation features.

## 2. DEVICE IDENTIFICATION

To use the Service, a unique Device Identifier (Device UUID) is automatically generated for your installation of the App. This Device UUID acts as your primary identifier for accessing the Service, managing subscriptions, and tracking usage limits. You are responsible for any activity associated with your Device UUID.

## 3. USER CONTENT

### a. **Responsibility:**

You are solely responsible for the User Content you submit to the Service. You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary rights and permissions to use and submit your User Content and that your User Content does not violate any third-party rights (including copyright, trademark, privacy, or other personal or proprietary rights) or any applicable laws.

### b. **Prohibited Content:**

You agree not to submit User Content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, profane, hateful, or racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable. We reserve the right to refuse to process or to remove any User Content that violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable, in our sole discretion.

### c. **License to Us:**

By submitting User Content to the Service, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Content solely in connection with operating and providing the Service to you, including processing it through our AI models and those of our third-party AI providers (e.g., OpenAI). This license terminates when your User Content is deleted from our systems as per our data retention practices.

### d. **AI-Generated Output:**

The Service generates new images or modified versions of your User Content ("AI Output") based on your input. You acknowledge that AI Output is generated by complex algorithms and may sometimes be unexpected, inaccurate, or unintentionally biased. We make no warranties regarding the AI Output.

### b. **Your User Content:**

You retain all ownership rights to your original User Content.

### c. **AI Output:**

Subject to your compliance with these Terms and the terms of our third-party AI providers (e.g., OpenAI), you generally own the AI Output generated by the Service from your User Content. However, if the AI Output incorporates pre-existing content or intellectual property owned by us or third parties, your rights to use such AI Output may be limited. You are responsible for ensuring your use of AI Output complies with all applicable laws and third-party rights.

### d. **Commercial Use:**

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may use the AI Output for personal and commercial purposes, provided that such use does not violate any laws or third-party rights. However, we reserve the right to limit commercial use of certain AI-generated outputs in future updates to these Terms.
